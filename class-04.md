# HTML

## Links in HTML
* **Links** are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

* **How Links are created?** 
   * using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.


* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

* You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.

* You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

## Layout in HTML

#### Building blocks
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
* Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.


  * Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include:
    >> <h1> <p> <ul> <li>

  * Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include:

    >> <img> <b> <i>

#### Containing Elements

* If one block-level element sits inside another
  block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

* It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div> (or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation)

 * The <div> element that contains this group of
elements is then referred to as the containing element.

* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning

* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.


# JavaScript
## Functions Methods and Objects 

* Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.

* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.

* An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.

* In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.

* Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

* **How does pair programming work?**
  pair programming commonly involves two roles:
  * The Driver: is the programmer who is typing
  * The Navigator: uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer


  ### Why pair program?

  1.  Greater efficiency

      * Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product). So, in the long-run, it’s often actually more efficient than two people working on separate features.


  2. Engaged collaboration

     * When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help. Ultimately, this boosts overall confidence.

  3. Learning from fellow students

    * the developers in a pairing have different skill sets. If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area.

  4. Social skills

     * Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.

  5. Job interview readiness

      *  the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.

  6. Work environment readiness
     * Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
