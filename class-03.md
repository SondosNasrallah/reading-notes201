# HTML & JavaScript
### Lists in HTML

* **Ordered lists**: are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
   * The ordered list is created with
the <ol> element.
   * <li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li
   stands for list item.)

* **Unordered lists**: are lists that begin with a bullet point.
    * The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
    * Each item in the list is placed between an opening      <li> tag and a closing </li> tag.

* **Definition lists**: are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
    * The definition list is created with the <dl> element    and usually consists of a series of terms and their     definitions.
    * <dt> This is used to contain the term being defined.
    * <dd> This is used to contain the definition.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

### Boxes
* At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.

* You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.

* It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.

* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.

* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

### Arrays in JavaScript
* **Array** is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

* You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array).

* The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The
values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array.

#### **if else** 
if ... e1se statement allows you to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition evaluates to true
2. another set if the condition is false

#### Switch
* A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.
* Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

* Data types can be coerced from one type to another
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
