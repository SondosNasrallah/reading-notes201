## Tables
* What's a Table?
  A table represents information in a grid format.

* Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row.

 ### **Basic Table Structure** 

 * The <'table'> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

 * <'tr'> You indicate the start of each
 row using the opening tag. (The tr stands for table row.)
 
 * <'td'> Each cell of a table is represented using a element. (The td stands for table data.)

* <'th'> element is used just like the <'td'> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table heading.)

* You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

## Objects 

* An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.

* In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.

* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
