 ## CREATE STUNNING ANIMATED CHARTS WITH CHART.JS

 * Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.


 * It's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single canvas node to render the chart.

    >> Basic usage of canvas:
    *  canvas element has only two attributes, width and height
    * The canvas element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, background…).


* with canvas you can :
   *  Draw shapes (rectangles, paths, triangle, Lines, Arcs, Bezier and quadratic curves, making combinations, Path2D objects)

* Applying styles and colors
   * Colors
   * Transparency
   * Line styles
   * Gradients
   * Patterns
   * Shadows 
   

* Drawing text
