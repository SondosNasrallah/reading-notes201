## HTML

- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

### What are the main elements in HTML? 
   1. Headings
      HTML has six "levels" of headings:
        1. <h1> is used for main headings.
        2. <h2> - <h6> are used for Subheadings.
  2.  Paragraphs <p>
  3.  Bold & Italic (<b> & <i>)
  4.  Superscript & Subscript (<sup> & <sub>)
  5.  White Space
  6.  Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
      1. <br /> : if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag.
      2. <hr /> : To create a break between
      themes.
  7. Strong & Emphasis:
     1. <strong> : indicates that its content has strong      importance. By default, browsers will showthe          contents of this element in bold.
     2. <em> : will show the contents of this element in   italic.
  8. Quotations: (<blockquote> & <q>) 


  -  **Semantic Markup**: are some text elements that are not intended to affect     the structure of your web pages, but they do an extra information to the pages.


## CSS
 
 ### What CSS does? 
  CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear
### CSS & HTML
  CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

 ### How CSS works?
 - CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

 - CSS stylesheet divided into 3 Types shown in figure below.

- Rules in CSS are made up of **selectors** (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and **declarations** (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

- Declarations are made up of two parts: 
 1. the properties of the element that you want to change,   and the values of those properties. For example, the       font-family.
 2. property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
  specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

## JavaScript 
  

  **Script** is a series of instructions that a computer     can follow one-by-one.
  Each individual instruction or step is known as a *statement*.
 >> Statements should end with a semicolon.

  - Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.

**Variables** are used to temporarily store pieces of
   information used in the script.

   >> Arrays are special types of variables that store more
     than one piece of related information.

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
   strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
 
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
   - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.


  ### DECISIONS AND LOOPS

   - **DECISIONS ** : Using the results of evaluations, you   can decide which path your script should go down.
   - **LOOPS ** : many occasions where you will want to       perform the same set of steps repeatedly.


    
### Comparison operators

- *Comparison operators* (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.

### Logical operators 
   - And **&&**
   - OR **||**
   - NOT **!**

   - *Logical operators* : allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators

*  if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

* switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).

* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.

* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
