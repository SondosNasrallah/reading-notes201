# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

### **Structure**
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
   brackets) to give the information they surround special
   meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
   the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
   the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
   about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.

### **Markup**

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the  

   <!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.


### HTML5 Layout

* The point of creating these new elements is so that web
page authors can use them to help describe the structure of
the page.

### Process and design 

* **Wireframe** : is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

* It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.

* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
