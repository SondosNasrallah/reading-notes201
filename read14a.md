# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

**Transforms**

* The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.


* The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

  **Transitions & Animations**

 * With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
     * The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

 * Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.
